		        NANOGrav(North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves) is a collaboration of scientists working to detect and study gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein in his Theory of General Relativity. In his theory, mass distorts space and time. Extreme massive binary systems such as supermassive binary black holes produce gravitational waves. Nanohertz gravitational waves have exceptionally long wavelengths, which is why scientists were unable to build a large enough detector to observe them. However, the Universe provided us with a way about this hindrance in the form of miliseconds pulsars - the rapidly spinning, super dense remnants of massive stars. During their rotation, milisecond pulsars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, which are detected on Earth as one "tick" of a clock. &nbsp;When pulsar signals travel across space to the Earth, signals experience a delay or an advance due to gravitational waves distorting the space. Hence, by studying and analysing pulsar data, we will most likely be able to detect gravitational waves. Today we are still only seeing the Universe through the lens of electromagnetic radiation, and the ability to unravel the gravitational wave data would completely change how we perceive the Universe.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="introduction">
			The Bridge is online portal for PTA data, data products, and data analysis tools. 
			 Data products (TOAs, residuals, noise models, and likelihoods of various gravitational
			  wave signals) are available at multiple stages of analysis.  Tools are available for 
			  use online, and are also available for downloading and running on your local machine.
			</p>
			<p class="introduction">
			To get started please click the “Analysis” tab at the top of the page, and simply press 
			“Engage” which will produce a default set of residual plots.  After the residual plots 
			have appeared press “Engage analysis” and the data will be searched for gravitational 
			waves and the results displayed.  This exercise will give you a sense of how the Bridge 
			is run. 
			</p>
			<p class="introduction">
			Now try adjusting some settings and rerunning the analysis.  For example, try selecting 
			only a subset of pulsars instead of all of them.  Then rerun the analysis on the subset 
			of pulsars.  The likelihood of a gravitational wave will decrease.
